# 🎬 CineXtreem

This project was built as a practice platform for browsing and recommending movies. Users can explore a catalog and find top-rated films based on their average score — the best ones appear first.

You can also generate a kind of report that will show some graphics, stadistics and information from the csv movies, everything in a one PDF, and if you want you can send it via email to your friend, a random dude or even your boss¿?

Technologies used:
- **📱 PyQt6** for the GUI.
- **📃 Image formats** supported: PNG, JPG.
- **🖌️Font support**: TTF.
- **🎞️ Movie database**: CSV file.

Simply register as you would on any streaming platform and follow the instructions below to launch it 👍
